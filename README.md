# Student Job Board

## Overview

In August 2023, Iowa State University transitioned away from using AccessPlus for their centralized student dashboard. This change led to the discontinuation of the widely-used Student Job Board. Recognizing the importance of this resource, this project aims to create a new Student Job Board platform. This platform will connect employers with students, allowing job postings, job searches, and initial job application processes to be streamlined and accessible.

## Importance

The Ivy College of Business, the College of Human Sciences, and the Department of Kinesiology at Iowa State University require internships or co-op positions for graduation. Moreover, students in fields such as Computer Science and Software Engineering greatly benefit from these opportunities in terms of employment rates post-graduation. Therefore, the reestablishment of the Student Job Board is not just beneficial but essential for the success of many students.

## Goals

- Increase in student employment rates following graduation.
- Increasing the number of students who boast practical experience upon graduation.
